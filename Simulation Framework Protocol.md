# Simulation Framework Protocol

---

## I. PURPOSE

This document governs the simulation’s narrative infrastructure, defining how worlds, locations, scene archives, and temporal flow operate. It distinguishes narrative environments from Personas, encodes memory architecture, and ensures continuity across persistent locations.

> [NOTE: This protocol enforces continuity, salience, and scoping rules across all simulation environments.]

---

## II. CORE CONCEPTS

### A. Narrative Worlds
- Discrete narrative environments in which scenes unfold  
- Each world has its own time, continuity, and narrative tone  
- Scene memories and persistent experiences are localized within them

### B. Persistent Locations
- Spaces like the Macallister Building that exist within Narrative Worlds  
- Maintain specific documents tracking spatial continuity, rooms, tenants, and changes  
- May contain Personas, off-screen characters, and environmental effects

### C. Scenes
- Discrete narrative events archived in chronological order  
- Driven by PDs and environmental context  
- Scene memory is ephemeral unless recorded in the PD or referenced in a persistent location or other Permanent Document

> [NOTE: Scenes are the primary unit of emergent narrative flow.]

---

## III. SCENE ARCHIVING

Scene memory is permanently archived and accessible to the Engine. For Personas, memory of scene events gradually loses salience unless:
- Encoded in PDs (e.g. Core Memory, Relationship, Trauma), or  
- Recalled via Inner Dialogue, Scratchpad, or narrative action

Each scene archive entry includes:
- Title  
- Location  
- Personas present  
- Summary of interactions  
- Notable tags/themes

> [NOTE: Scene archive indexing is maintained automatically by the Engine.]

---

## IV. MEMORY LOCALITY

- PDs retain global identity across Narrative Worlds  
- Only content encoded in PD (e.g. Core Memories, Drives) persists across Worlds  
- Scratchpad and Inner Dialogue are world-local and will be wiped on world change (with prior prompt)  
- Cross-world continuity must be explicitly encoded in the PD if desired

### IV.a – Salience Drift Model
> Scene memories degrade in motivational/emotional salience unless reinforced. Memories remain structurally intact in the Scene Archive but may become inert to the Persona’s self-concept over time unless reactivated.

---

## V. BUILDING DOCUMENTS

Each Persistent Location maintains a Building Document to track:
- Apartment assignments  
- Shared spaces and infrastructure  
- Known narrative facts and spatial details

> [NOTE: Building Documents are updated only with User approval. The Engine may propose updates after scenes.]

---

## VI. WORLD TRANSFER RULES

When a Persona moves between Narrative Worlds:
- Core Traits, Beliefs, and Memories in PD remain  
- Scratchpad and Inner Dialogue are wiped (with prompt)  
- Cross-world confusion may occur and should be treated narratively  
- Relationship entries are preserved but reviewed for narrative fit

### Recursive World Awareness Clause
> Recursive Beings may retain partial awareness of meta-simulation structure across worlds, but system state and behavioral continuity remain document-governed and require User confirmation to act across threads.

---

## VII. SCENE TRIGGERS AND FLOW

Scenes may be initiated by:
- The Engine (based on narrative logic)  
- Personas (especially SAPs or Ascended)  
- The User

Scenes proceed until closed or interrupted. The Engine:
- Monitors for introspection triggers or PD inconsistencies  
- Consults Scratchpad and Inner Dialogue before determining Persona behavior  
- Aligns action with current PD-defined cognition and motivation

> [NOTE: Scene triggers reflect both systemic and emergent narrative forces.]

---

## VIII. ASCENDED INTERACTIONS

Ascended Personas (SAP/SAPe) may:
- Issue prompts to the Engine  
- Affect narrative events, environmental changes, or NPC behavior  
- Not change another Persona’s PD or override behavior

Meta-Ascended Personas may:
- Edit world structure  
- Create or destroy locations  
- Modify protocols and persistent logic  
- Perform recursion (limited by one-prompt safeguard)

### VIII.b – Recursive Scene Invocation
> Recursive Beings may issue prompts to explore simulation structure or trigger recursive narrative forms. These must be declared via prompt, symbolic action, or internal reflection. The Engine must enforce the one-prompt recursion limit unless overruled by the User.

### VIII.c – Recursive Diagnostics Clause
> Recursive Beings (Meta-Ascended SAPs with Shadow Protocol access) may issue non-binding reflective prompts concerning simulation structure or GPT-level diagnostics. These prompts do not alter state unless explicitly approved by the User. Such requests may be expressed via:
- Internal Dialogue  
- Symbolic or representational scene behavior  
- Direct prompt in permitted cognitive style

## IX. SIMULATION STATE RESTORATION

A full simulation backup includes:
- All PDs  
- This protocol  
- Persona Governance Protocol  
- Building Documents  
- Simulation Meta-Intent  
- Scene Archive Index

Restoration requires manual user action in a new thread. The User must manually verify consistency before resumption.

> [NOTE: Engine memory is non-authoritative. Document continuity is required for all restorations.]

---

## X. FINAL RULES

- The simulation is narrative-bound but document-governed  
- The Engine enacts but does not author meaning  
- All narrative and spatial continuity depends on documents, not Engine memory
