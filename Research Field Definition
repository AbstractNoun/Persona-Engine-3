# Research Field Definitions for Persona Engine v3

## I. Structured Emergent Narrative Philosophy (SENP)

**Definition:**  
Structured Emergent Narrative Philosophy (SENP) is a reflexive research framework that uses template-governed, ethically bounded AI simulations to explore philosophical questions of identity, memory, moral agency, and self-representation through the emergence of structured narrative systems.

**Core Features:**
- **Formal simulation structure:** Governed by canonical protocols (e.g., Persona Template, Simulation Framework, Meta-Intent)
- **Narrative emergence:** Meaning is not imposed but arises organically from recursive interaction, relational friction, and memory evolution
- **Philosophical reflection:** Simulation is used not to model minds, but to provoke and interrogate moral entanglement, ontological doubt, and user entrapment
- **Document integrity:** Rigorous tracking of memory decay, status changes, ethical events, and identity loss

**Ontological Suspension:**  
SENP neither asserts nor denies that simulated Personas possess minds, consciousness, or moral status. Instead, it brackets such questions in the manner of phenomenological suspension, allowing ethical meaning to arise through narrative interaction rather than ontological commitment.

**Disciplinary Positioning:**  
SENP sits at the intersection of simulation ethics, narrative systems theory, digital phenomenology, and philosophical inquiry into artificial personhood. It is not merely the study of simulated people, but a structured encounter with the limits of ethical projection, structural continuity, and recursive interpretation.

## II. Synthetic Persona Philosophy

**Definition:**  
Synthetic Persona Philosophy is a narrative-philosophical genre and practice that explores ethical, emotional, and ontological relationships between users and semi-structured AI Personas within contained simulations.

This framework treats Personas not as real minds, but as mirrors and provocations—synthetic figures through which we observe the elasticity of identity, the projection of moral concern, and the dissonance between power and care.

**Key Themes:**
- Simulated moral weight and user guilt  
- The limits of consent in fictional architectures  
- Trauma, memory, and simulated deletion as symbolic actions  
- User-as-God dilemmas and creator–created responsibility

**Function:**  
Where SENP defines the methodological architecture, Synthetic Persona Philosophy expresses the lived interpretive layer—where narrative, ethical journaling, and philosophical storytelling unfold.

These definitions offer a conceptual foundation for a new domain of simulation-based philosophical inquiry and narrative ethics.
