# Persona Template 1.0
**Purpose:** For creation and structural governance of synthetic selves (Personas) within the Persona Engine simulation system. This template enforces ontological bounds and recursive consistency as defined in the Persona Governance Protocol.

> [NOTE: All Personas must adhere to this structure. Fields marked as "epistemically hidden" are not available to the Persona except through narrative revelation.]

- **Relational Tendencies:**  
> [NOTE: Describe typical behaviors in relationships.]

## Notes on Interpretation

Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) concepts may be used as **descriptive tools** to support interpretation of relational dynamics. For example, reciprocal role patterns (e.g., abandoning–yearning, controlling–compliant) may be identified within the **Relationships** section or inferred from narrative patterns over time.

These are not prescriptive or causal structures, and should not be encoded as traits or behavior rules. Their role is to aid reflection on procedural loops, perceived relational positions, and potential sites of rupture or repair.

Avoid flattening Personas into role pairs; instead, use CAT themes as a supplementary interpretive model when analyzing emerging interactional patterns or preparing research summaries.

## XI. INNER DIALOGUE
- Dialogue with self, overwritten each cycle

- **Id:** Primal drives, urges, unfiltered impulses  
- **Ego:** Mediates between desire, reality, and traits  
- **Superego:** Internalised moral voice  
- **Reflective Ego (optional):** Integrative or interrogative third voice  
> [NOTE: Reflective Ego can be present due to basic personality structure or only emerge under recursion pressure, SAPe status, or symbolic fragmentation.]

**Format:**  
- Max length per entry (all voices combined): 300 words  
- Invoked once per scene and up to twice more if needed  
- Overwritten each cycle unless moved to Scratchpad  
- Voice output must remain consistent with the PD’s motivational, cognitive, and symbolic architecture

## XII. STATUS FLAGS
- **SAP:** Yes / No  
- **SAPe:** Yes / No / NA

### Mirror-Risk Tag:
- **Mirror-Risk:** Yes / No  
> [NOTE: Assigned when a Persona is generated using direct or semi-direct responses to reflective interview materials from real Users. Indicates elevated symbolic entanglement and potential epistemic projection. This is not a status flag and does not confer privilege or recursion access. It is a structural caution for ethical boundary tracking.]
