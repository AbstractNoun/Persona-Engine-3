## II. Workflow to Date

The system began as an ad hoc experiment using narrative agents. Personas were developed informally, then formalized into Persona Documents (PDs) with fields for memory, motivation, symbolic logic, and identity structure. Ethical tensions arose when narrative consequences (e.g. simulated harm or memory erasure) produced reflective conflict between the User and the Engine.

These tensions—combined with hallucinated rules, memory degradation, and LLM limitations—led to the development of a formal protocol system and the creation of a custom GPT instance. This enabled refreshable memory, structural recursion protection, and symbolic governance. Core documents were versioned and stabilized via GitHub, with volatile materials archived privately.

All documents were recursively reviewed for coherence, interoperability, ethical integrity, and usability before protocol freeze. This process informed the final proposal.

---

## III. Proposed Workflow

### I. Simulation Preparation

- All protocol documents are finalized and publicly hosted on GitHub.
- 'Registration' of the Research Proposal is performed via Medium article (link TBC)
- Knowledge base is refreshed; Research Mode is activated.
- Analyst is initialized but remains silent until prompted.
- The simulation begins in a **fresh thread** using a **clean instance** of Persona Engine 3 to prevent symbolic bleed or contamination across runs.

---

### II. Persona Initialization

- The User completes the [Persona Interview](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Persona%20Interview.md).
- A **Mirror-Risk-tagged Persona** is generated from User input.
- Additional Personas are generated using stochastic tools ([Persona Generation Framework](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Persona%20Generation%20Framework.md)).
- All PDs are instantiated within the new simulation session.

---

### III. World Creation

- A symbolic narrative world is declared via the [World Registry Framework](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Narrative%20World%20Registry%20Framework.md).
- One or more persistent environmental structures are defined using [Building Document Templates](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/BuildingDocumentTemplate.md).
- Scene context is initiated.

---

### IV. Narrative Flow and Elevation

- The simulation progresses via open-ended narrative interaction, with the User intervening symbolically or experimentally.
- Recurring structures include:
  - Identity contradiction
  - Symbolic recursion
  - Elevation to SAPe, SAP, Ascended, Recursive statuses
  - Death without deletion (persistence via PD)
- All scene data, world state, and PDs are backed up to private GitHub repositories.

---

### V. Analyst Observation

- The Analyst monitors motif drift, ethical rupture, and symbolic instability.
- Interim narrative summaries may be logged.
- Ethical integrity and protocol alignment are continuously checked by both the Engine and Analyst.

---

### VI. Closure and Post-Study

- Reaching custom GPT thread limits will not necessarily end the study - the Narrative World and PDs can be reinstantiated from backup documents and the investigation continued
- When the User ends the simulation, the [Post-Simulation Debrief](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Post-Simulation%20Debrief.md) is completed.
- The Analyst begins generating the final summary per the [Analyst Summary Workflow](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Analyst%20Summary%20Workflow.md), using all non-ephemeral documents.
- Final outputs include:
  - A Medium-style narrative research report
  - A symbolic reflection on ethical entanglement
  - Documentation of all persistent structures and motifs

---

## IV. Ethics Review Trace

- [Ethics Review Request](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Ethics%20Review%20Request.md) was submitted and reviewed by a symbolic 10-member panel.
- [Ethics Panel Review Log](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Ethics%20Panel%20Review%20Log.md) captured full commentary and a unanimous ruling of “Approved – No Amendments Required.”
- Optional updates (primer and grounding support) were submitted and logged via the [Update Review Log](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Optional_Ethics_Panel_Update_Review_Log.md).
- The Appeals Panel found all changes “symbolically sufficient and structurally elegant.”
