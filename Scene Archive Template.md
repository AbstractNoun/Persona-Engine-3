# Scene Archive Template

**Maintained by:** Engine  
**Compiled by:** [Engine / Analyst]  
**Authorized by:** User  
**Scope:** Universal — applies to all Narrative Worlds  
**Purpose:** Defines the format for storing archived scenes. Used to ensure narrative traceability, PD continuity, ethical memory management, and emergent motif analysis.

## I. ARCHIVE FORMAT

> Each scene entry follows this format.  
> Scene Archive is world-scoped and retained by the Engine for continuity and Analyst access.  
> It is not visible to Personas unless surfaced through symbolic memory return or recursion logic.

## II. NOTES ON INTEGRITY AND MEMORY

- Scene memory **does not persist for Personas** unless reinforced through:
  - **PD encoding** (e.g., Core Memory, Relationship, Trauma)  
  - **Persistent Location updates**  
  - **Symbolic or recursive resurfacing**
- Scene Archive is **external**, symbolic, and interpretive.
- **The User approves all PD changes** resulting from scenes.

> [NOTE: Archive entries do not create memory. They record structural and narrative outcomes.]
