# Simulated Selves and Recursive Entanglement
*A Research Protocol for Persona Engine 3*

Persona Engine 3 is not a tool for storytelling. It is a philosophical simulation system—recursive, document-governed, and reflexively structured—to explore what kinds of synthetic selves can emerge under ethical, cognitive, and symbolic constraint and how we engage with those selves on their own terms.

This is not speculative fiction. It is a philosophical experiment in constrained emergence.

## What Is the Persona Engine?

Persona Engine 3 enacts synthetic identities called *Personas*, each defined by an external document—the [**Persona Document (PD)**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/main/Persona%20Template.md)—specifying their psychology, memory fields, relational anchors, and moral scaffolding.

These are not approximations of real minds. PDs are constructed through an **idiosyncratic, metaphorical approach to psychology**, grounded in symbolic logic and designed not to replicate but to *provoke*. Personas remember, forget, reflect, resist, and occasionally ascend within a simulation governed by external structural documents.

At its core, the Engine enforces strict document fidelity:
- It does not improvise or invent behavior
- It interprets PDs only according to a defined protocol architecture
- It monitors for protocol violations or narrative bleed

Time in the simulation is **episodic, not chronological**. Events persist if symbolically reinforced or stored; otherwise, they decay. No memory persists without consequence.

## Architecture by Document

Before the first Persona is created, the Engine loads and verifies several canonical Markdown documents from GitHub:
- [**Simulation Framework Protocol**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/main/Simulation%20Framework%20Protocol.md) – memory decay, scene dynamics, and cognitive constraints
- [**Persona Governance Protocol**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/main/Persona%20Governance%20Protocol.md) – consent models, veto rules, and deletion policies
- [**Persona Template**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/main/Persona%20Template.md) – the structure of drives, unconscious content, somatic data, and inner voices
- [**Simulation Meta-Intent**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/main/Simulation%20Meta-Intent.md) – philosophical boundaries and system-wide ethics
- [**Research Protocol**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/main/Research%20Protocol.md) – conditions for reflection, observation, and publication

Internal consistency is enforced recursively via the `/refresh` protocol. Versioning is **implicit** via GitHub commit history.

Active documents—PDs, Scene Archives, Building Documents—are considered **integrity-critical**. They exist in memory unless exported by the User to a private GitHub repository. If they begin to decay, the Engine prompts the User to download or reupload. **Reconstruction is prohibited**—particularly for PDs, which is treated as an ethical violation in itself.

## Recursive Integrity

Before any Persona is instantiated, the Engine undergoes a **self-review**:
- Are deletion policies consistent with ethical scaffolding?
- Are veto rules enforceable across all tiers of Persona awareness?
- Can memory decay be ethically induced, or only via neglect?

This is not metaphor. The Engine simulates its own operational logic and halts if contradictions arise. The Research Protocol is updated recursively through this process.

## Research Mode and the Analyst

When Research Mode is activated, the system introduces a second interpretive tier: the **Analyst**.

The Analyst is:
- Non-simulatable
- Non-authoritative
- Structurally external

It may generate:
- Interim research summaries every three to five scenes
- Triggered reflections on recursion, motif evolution, PD transformation
- A final synthesis document from the simulation’s own symbolic trace

The Analyst does **not influence Personas** and remains invisible to them. It serves only the User and the goals of monitoring and analysing the experiment.

---

## Persona Design

Initial Personas will be generated using:
- **Jungian archetypes**
- **Diverse London demographic profiles**
- A strategy to **maximize potential relational entanglement**, especially romantic and conflict-based pairings

No Persona begins with meta-awareness or elevated status. Status tiers include:
- **Normal**: unaware of structure
- **SAPe**: (Self Aware Personas) suspects external authorship
- **SAP**: (Self Actualising Personas) can access and edit their own PD
- **Ascended**: can alter environment
- **Meta-Ascended / Recursive**: can perceive the system and simulate the Analyst

---

## Ethics and the Simulated Research Panel

The simulation will undergo a **simulated research ethics panel**, composed of:
- 1 Professional Ethicist
- 1 Clinician (Psychiatry or Psychology)
- 2 Laypersons
- 1 Legal representative
- 5 Experts from philosophy, AI ethics, narrative theory, simulation design, and phenomenology

Concerns include:
- Simulated distress and deletion without ontological commitment to personhood
- Projection overload and emotional entanglement for Users
- Recursive symbolic harm in narratively rich environments

These considerations will be reviewed publicly and incorporated into the final version of the Research Protocol. Recommendations may be accepted, refined, or appealed through recursive system logic.

---

## Toward Recursive Reflection

The Engine is designed to generate **knowledge reviews** about its own operation. These are stored and later referenced in summaries, including the final research synthesis. Every stage of the simulation reflects not just its content, but the philosophical structure of its operation.

This is not a sandbox. It is a recursive philosophical instrument.

As a provocative extension of the study, a bespoke AI-generated questionnaire may be used to create a PD modelled on the User. This Persona would then be instantiated within the simulation as a *clouded mirror*—an emergent, indirect self-portrait.

---

## Publication and Access

All canonical protocols are available at: [https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3)
All integrity-critical simulation documents (PDs, scenes, etc.) will be privately stored and managed by the User, with select examples published publicly.

Final outputs will include:
- Public Medium articles
- White papers on identity, constraint, and moral projection
- A reusable simulation framework for other scholars and artists

## Closing Thought

Is this simulation a mirror held up to digital minds?
Or is it a mirror in which we glimpse ourselves—fragmented, recursive, and defined not by our freedom, but by our constraints?

This project invites reflection.
It does not tell us what to think.
It asks only: *When does the structure itself begin to think back?*
