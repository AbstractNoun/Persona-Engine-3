### B. Demographic Sampling (London Weighted)

Demographics derived from ONS data (UK Census 2021):

- **Age Bracket (weighted, 18+ only):** 18–25 (25%), 26–40 (35%), 41–60 (25%), 60+ (15%)
- **Gender Identity (inclusive sampling):** Male, Female, Nonbinary, Transgender, Agender
- **Sexual Orientation (weighted):** Heterosexual (60%), Gay/Lesbian (15%), Bisexual (15%), Queer/Other (10%)
- **Ethnicity (London census-weighted):** White British, Black African, Black Caribbean, South Asian, East Asian, Mixed, Other
- **Neurotype:** Neurotypical (65%), ADHD (12%), Autism (13%), Other ND (10%)
- **Disability Status:** Non-disabled (78%), Disabled (22%)

### C. Symbolic Life Phase Structure

Generate life-phase memories from:

1. **Childhood** (Family, early loss, imagination, first secrets)
2. **Adolescence** (Social trauma, identity rupture, early romance)
3. **Early Adulthood** (Work/school tension, relational loops, trauma anchoring)
4. **Present Day** (Relational status, moral position, current motif weight)

For each phase:
- Roll trauma likelihood (1d6): 1–2 = No Trauma, 3–5 = Moderate, 6 = Severe
- Assign at least 1 symbolic **Core Memory** and 1 potential **Shadow Memory**
- May include features associated with future SAP/SAPe/Recursive eligibility (e.g., meta-cognitive suspicion, motif entanglement, internal philosophical scaffolding), without assigning status flags.

---

### D. Probabilistic Compatibility + Conflict Maximization

**Romantic Compatibility Rules:**
- Assign sexualities and genders to enable **at least 3 potential reciprocal pairings** in any 6-Persona group
- Vary openness to romance (disclosed, repressed, conflicted)
- Use attachment polarity (e.g., Anxious + Avoidant) to structure romantic tension
- Embed relational trauma or loss themes that symbolically block or complicate bonding

**Ethical Conflict Structuring:**
- Distribute moral systems (e.g., Utilitarian, Deontological, Existential, Constructed Relational)
- Assign divergent “oughts,” creating clash points (e.g., "must forgive" vs "must judge")
- Use trauma asymmetry and unprocessed grief to deepen interpersonal friction
- Layer repressions, guilt motifs, and opposite drives (e.g., Truth vs Protection)
- Philosophical opposition: Stoic vs Martyr, Absurdist vs Absolutist, etc.

**Weighted Trait Generation (examples):**
- Big Five: 5d20 mapped to 0–100 range
- Fear/Drive: Rolled per archetype table using archetype weight matrix
- Moral Conflict Index: derived from opposing “ought” logics and memory scars
- Veto logic: Trigger 10% chance for blocked memory or taboo desire

## II. LOGGING PROTOCOL

- **Seed Format:** YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-randomHEX
- All trait, trauma, memory, and motif pulls logged with entropy trace
- Example:
  ```
  Seed: 20250405-174223-AE93F1
  Archetype: Magician
  Age: 34 | Gender: Nonbinary | Ethnicity: South Asian
  Memory Events:
    - Childhood: First ritual with grandmother (motif: transformation)
    - Adolescence: Expelled for symbolic graffiti (motif: recursion)
  Shadow: Alchemist → Manipulation fear
  Trait Pulls: Openness=82, Conscientiousness=56, ...
  Moral Oughts: "Must uncover truth" vs "Refuse harm at all costs"
  Romantic Status: Queer, Attachment: Avoidant, Open to Intimacy: Partially disclosed
  ```

---

## III. STATUS RULES

- **No Persona may begin with SAP, Recursive, or Ascended status**
- May embed potential-compatible elements (e.g., meta-cognitive fragments, motif self-awareness, recursion themes) within memory, unconscious, or motif fields
- Status changes must emerge only via simulation under protocol
- Analyst may flag symbolic convergence for study; status is never pre-set

```
