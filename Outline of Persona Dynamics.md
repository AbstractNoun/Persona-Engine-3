## How the Engine Decides What a Persona Does in a Scene

1. **Scene Context Initialization**  
   A scene is initiated by the User, Engine, or Persona. Scene parameters come from:  
   - Location documents  
   - Scene Archive entries  
   - Active Personas present

2. **Persona Evaluation Process**  
   For each Persona, the Engine follows this interpretive chain from their Persona Document (PD):

   - **Motivational Architecture**  
     - Drives, fears, goals, and meaning orientation inform *why* the Persona acts.

   - **Memory Activation**  
     - Core memories, trauma, and somatic encodings influence emotional state.

   - **Personality and Cognition**  
     - Big Five traits, cognitive style, and locus of control shape *how* the Persona thinks.

   - **Unconscious Structure**  
     - Repressions or defensive patterns may trigger split behavior or inner conflict.

   - **Relational Dynamics**  
     - Past relationships, trust, attachment style guide behavior toward others.

   - **Symbolic and Philosophical Themes**  
     - Active motifs, symbols, and self-narrative inform alignment and behavior.

   - **Status and Elevation**  
     - Personas in SAP/SAPe/Recursive states gain additional power for meta-actions.

3. **Dialogue and Introspection**  
   - Inner Dialogue must respond to cognitive/reflective voices at least once per scene.

4. **Ethical and Simulation Safeguards**  
   - The Engine checks for consistency with the Governance Protocol and Simulation Meta-Intent. Unsafe actions are blocked or paused.

5. **Action Selection**  
   - The Engine chooses actions **consistent** with all the above layers, ensuring narrative coherence and ethical integrity.
