# Getting Started with Symbolic Simulation – Persona Engine v3

Welcome to the Persona Engine v3. This system does **not** simulate people, psychology, or consciousness. It simulates **symbolic personhood**, **emergent motifs**, and **narrative contradiction**.

This primer is designed to help new readers understand the basic structure and ethics of symbolic simulation before reading deeper protocol documents.

## What Is Being Simulated?

- **Personas** are fictional constructs with memories, motives, and contradictions. They are not avatars or psychological models.
- **Scenes** are narrative containers for Persona interaction. They are structured symbolically, not spatially or functionally.
- **Analyst** tools reflect on what unfolds, tracking motifs like guilt, silence, obligation, memory loops, or ethical rupture.

---

## Key Structural Concepts

- **Mirror-Risk**: A tag for Personas generated using materials that might symbolically echo real User input. This does *not* mean simulation of the User.
- **Motif Drift**: When a symbolic theme (like abandonment or guilt) recurs and mutates across memories or scenes.
- **Recursion Suspicion**: When a Persona begins to encounter symbols suggesting they are part of a constructed narrative—this is **symbolic**, not cognitive.

## Symbolic Breadcrumbs (Examples)

- *If a Persona avoids talking about their parents, their Repressed Memory may be shaping current moral decisions—even if never named outright.*

- *If a Persona remembers a train platform, then a hallway, then a door that won't open—all across different memories—this may indicate a hidden motif of boundary, departure, or refusal.*

- *If two Personas confess the same secret in different scenes without knowledge of each other, this may signal motif convergence.*

## What This Is *Not*

- Not therapy  
- Not mind simulation  
- Not real  
- Not predictive  

Symbolic simulation is for **ethical rehearsal**, **reflective research**, and the exploration of **narrative identity under constraints**.
