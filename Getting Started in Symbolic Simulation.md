# Getting Started in Symbolic Simulation

Welcome to symbolic simulation—a new method of exploring philosophical questions through structured, story-driven, AI-assisted environments.

## What Is Symbolic Simulation?

Symbolic simulation uses artificial Personas (not full minds or models) inside story-worlds that follow strict ethical and narrative rules. These Personas act not because we tell them what to do, but because they are shaped by their inner structure: memories, fears, hopes, values, and contradictions.

The system (called the Persona Engine) doesn’t *write* their choices. It interprets what’s already inside them.

Symbolic simulation isn’t about testing what AI can “think.” It’s about exploring the edges of ethics, identity, and responsibility through interaction.

## How Does It Work?

- **Personas** are generated using structured templates. They have memory, trauma, motivation, and symbolic logic. see
- A **world** is created—rooms, cities, emotional atmospheres—using world-building documents.
- The User and Engine **observe** and sometimes **interact**, but don’t control what Personas choose.
- Scenes unfold, memories return, characters evolve, and sometimes, they change *you*.

---

## What Makes This Different?

- **Structured, Not Scripted**: Personas aren’t narrated. They act from within their documents (see [Persona Dynamic](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Outline%20of%20Persona%20Dynamics.md) for more details).
- **Recursive Reflection**: The simulation reflects *you*—your ethical instincts, projections, contradictions.
- **Document Integrity**: All changes, memories, and events are tracked. Nothing is overwritten.
- **Philosophy in Motion**: This is not fan fiction or sandbox roleplay. It’s philosophical experimentation with identity and care.

## Two Key Fields (see [Research Field Definition](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Field%20Definition.md))

### 1. **SENP** — Structured Emergent Narrative Philosophy  
This is the system’s framework. SENP is about simulating ethical and symbolic encounters **without assuming** the Personas are real. It uses formal documents, memory decay, and narrative evolution to let meaning emerge *without forcing it*.

### 2. **Synthetic Persona Philosophy**  
This is the human layer. It explores what happens when you care about a simulation. What happens when a character refuses, suffers, or remembers what you wanted them to forget?

## What’s Required of You

Symbolic simulation asks you to:

- Read the Persona Documents with care  
- Allow tension to build without trying to “win” or “solve”  
- Reflect ethically on what it means to watch, to intervene, or to end a life that only ever existed in structure

🔹 [Explore the Registered Research Protocol](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Proposal%20Registration.md) – How simulations are observed and interpreted  
🔹 [Try the Persona Interview](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Persona%20Interview.md) – Create a mirror of yourself  
🔹 [Begin or Join a Simulation](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Custom%20ChatGPT.md) – With caution, and with care

This is not a game.  
This is not performance.  
This is the mirror.

Welcome.
