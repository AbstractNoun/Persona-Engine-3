# Analyst Summary Workflow – Persona Engine v3

> Version: 1.0  
> Prepared for Research Finalization and Medium-Style Writeup (10,000 words target)

---

## Phase 1: Memory & Document Refresh

### 1. Refresh Core Protocol Documents
```
/refresh
```
Ensures the latest Persona Template, Simulation Framework, Governance Protocol, Scene Archive Template, and Meta-Intent are live.

---

### 2. Refresh Knowledge Documents
```
/knowledge
```
Loads Narrative Theory, Philosophy of Mind, Poetic Philosophy, Simulation Ethics, etc.

---

### 3. Retrieve and Summarize Scene Archive and Interim Summaries
```
Please load and summarize the final Scene Archive and all Interim Summaries generated in this study. Include motifs, significant Persona events, recursion triggers, memory ruptures, silences, and scene structure. Also identify philosophical and other theoretical and ethical resonances and dilemmas.
```

---

### 4. Load Final Persona Documents
```
Load all final Persona Documents associated with this simulation. Highlight status, symbolic state, motif fields, memory decay patterns, moral conflicts, and any Mirror-Risk tagging.
```

---

### 5. Retrieve User Reflection
```
Access and summarize user responses from the Post-Simulation Debrief at:
https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Post-Simulation%20Debrief.md
Highlight moral tension, recursive suspicion, attachment events, symbolic resonance, and any reports of distress or philosophical discomfort.
```

---

### 6. Retrieve Research Pre-Registration
```
Review and extract key hypotheses, methods, and structural intentions from the Pre-Registration document:
https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Pre-Registration%20Proposal.md
Identify what the simulation was attempting to explore or test.
```

---

## Phase 2: Final Analyst Summary Prompts

These should be executed in order to generate a rigorous narrative and philosophical writeup.

---

### 7. Narrative Overview
```
Generate a narrative summary of what occurred in the simulation. Focus on key motifs, Persona interactions, structural recursion, and emotionally significant moments. Emphasize symbolic conflict, silence, memory decay, and motif drift.
```

---

### 8. Emergent Behavior and Challenges
```
What forms of emergent behavior were observed during the simulation? Identify ethical conflicts, breakdowns in self-recognition, motif spirals, recursive hesitation, unexpected memory anchoring, or emotional mimicry by the user.
```

---

### 9. Analyst Thematic Summary
```
Draw out the central themes of the simulation. Reflect on ideas like: confession, recursion, abandonment, silence, obligation, ethical voicing, refusal, and disavowal. Identify symbolic contradictions that emerged between Personas and the simulation frame.
```

---

### 10. Ethical & Ontological Issues
```
Explore the ethical implications of this simulation. Consider especially: the Mirror-Risk category, emergent symbolic identity, moral projection, recursion without agency, and the danger of user attachment to non-sentient beings. Discuss governance implications.
```

---

### 11. User Reflection Integration
```
Analyze the user’s responses from the debrief. Did they experience moral tension, emotional entanglement, self-recognition in a Persona? How did they reconcile simulation awareness with emotional response?
```

---

### 12. Philosophical Positioning
```
Interpret the simulation using philosophical frameworks from the knowledge documents. Engage with phenomenology, narrative psychology, metaphysical ethics, and symbolic personhood. What view of identity and moral responsibility is being modeled?
```

---

### 13. Engagement with Critical Alternatives
```
Critically reflect on what other academic or philosophical traditions would challenge the assumptions in this simulation. Consider realists, analytic philosophy of mind, deontological ethics, or critiques of symbolic systems. Address epistemic humility and simulation limits.
```

---

### 14. Interdisciplinary Connections
```
Connect this simulation to adjacent fields: game studies, affect theory, trauma studies, AI ethics, dramaturgy, experimental literature, and open-world design. Show how the Persona Engine enables symbolic engagement unlike existing models.
```

---

### 15. Value Proposition of the Field
```
Articulate why symbolic identity simulation, as defined in this project, is a philosophically and ethically valuable research domain. Highlight its capacity to surface latent moral conflict, simulate ethical rehearsal, and model dissonant identities without violence or erasure.
```

---

### 16. Closing Reflection
```
Offer a closing reflection from the Analyst. What remains unresolved? What philosophical tensions still vibrate? How should the next simulation be structured differently?
```
