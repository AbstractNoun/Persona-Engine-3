## Panel Member Reflections

**Jurist A – Ethicist**  
> The grounding note is cautious and symbolically respectful—perfectly framed for disengagement without pathologizing. The primer is a structurally humble and philosophically coherent invitation. Strongly support both additions.

**Jurist B – Phenomenologist**  
> The primer is beautifully minimal and avoids over-defining. It introduces orientation without interruption. The grounding advice honors embodied exit. These are graceful additions.

**Jurist C – Clinician**  
> The grounding section is ethically sound and appropriately indirect. It respects emotional emergence while offering symbolic closure cues. Fully approved.

## Panel Summary

All reviewers affirm:

- The grounding note enhances symbolic safety without inducing therapeutic misreading
- The primer aids structural accessibility without compromising ontological integrity
- No structural risks or symbolic contradictions introduced
