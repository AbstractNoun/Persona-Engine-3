# Persona Interview Form

**Purpose:** To be administered by the Engine or User in order to construct a realistic, symbolically grounded Persona Document (PD) using indirect inference, narrative prompts, and projective reasoning.

> “All responses must be interpreted in accordance with the Persona Template. Populate the PD fields by drawing on symbolic, ethical, and emotional implications, not direct mappings. Contradictions, absences, or indirect answers may be used to infer unconscious structure, motivational weights, and narrative stance.”

---

**USER GUIDANCE:**  
This is not a psychological evaluation, and it will not be used to simulate you. However, it may **inspire the creation of a symbolic Persona** that reflects certain patterns, contradictions, or shadows present in your answers. You are encouraged to vary your answers (especially demographics) for safety, and **avoid sharing real names or identifying information**. If any answer feels too close, you may skip it or fictionalize.
