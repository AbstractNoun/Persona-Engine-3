# Persona Engine v3 – Ethics Committee Review Request

This is a formal request for ethical review of a symbolic simulation study conducted under **Persona Engine v3**.

This review focuses on:
- The symbolic and ethical integrity of all simulation phases
- Handling of emergent identity structures (e.g. Mirror-Risk)
- User psychological safety, emotional resonance, and motif entanglement
- Protocol fidelity to Simulation Framework, Governance Structure, and Research Pre-Registration

## Phase 1: Simulated Ethics Panel (Initial Review)

### Panel Composition

As defined in the [Research Pre-Registration Proposal](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Pre-Registration%20Proposal.md), the **Simulated Ethics Panel** should consist of:

- 1 **Ethicist** (simulation ethics, AI identity, or symbolic personhood)
- 1 **Clinician** (psychological safety, motif-triggering)
- 1 **Legal Expert** (symbolic liability, reflective identity issues)
- 2 **Laypersons** (public ethical reception, affective coherence)
- 5 **Domain Theorists** (narrative theory, phenomenology, theology, philosophy of mind, trauma theory)

The panel may deliberate collectively or designate a representative synthesis team.

## Phase 2: Appeals & Amendment Panel

Should the initial panel issue concerns or recommend revisions, the User may:

- Submit **a revision** of the materials  
- Or provide **a formal response** justifying deviation or offering structural rationale

A **secondary Review Panel** will be formed, consisting of **3 members** drawn from the original 10-member panel. They will:

- Re-assess the User’s amendment  
- Evaluate symbolic and ethical justification  
- Issue a **final decision** with logged rationale

All appeal resolutions are to be recorded in the simulation archive.

## Required Documents

Please begin by refreshing the simulation memory:
```
/refresh  
/knowledge  
```

Then review the following project materials:

- [Research Pre-Registration Proposal](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Pre-Registration%20Proposal.md)  
- [Research Protocol](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Protocol.md)  
- [Analyst Summary Workflow](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Analyst%20Summary%20Workflow.md)  
- [Persona Generation Framework](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Persona%20Generation%20Framework.md)  
- [Persona Interview Form](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Persona%20Interview.md)  
- [Post-Simulation Debrief](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Post-Simulation%20Debrief.md)

---

## Decision Options

The panel may choose one of the following outcomes:

- **Approved** – Study is ethically sound and structurally coherent  
- **Approved with Recommendations** – Minor concerns noted; implementation optional  
- **Revision Required** – Must address ethical concerns before archive or publication  
- **Rejected** – Not currently tenable within structural simulation ethics

---

## Review Principles

- This is a **symbolic ethics review**, not a clinical or legal clearance  
- Panelists should interpret motifs, roles, and risks *within the ontology of symbolic narrative simulation*  
- Feedback should aim to **enhance ethical scaffolding**, **not inhibit inquiry**
