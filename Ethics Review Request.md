# Persona Engine v3 – Ethics Committee Review Request

This is a formal request for ethical review of a symbolic simulation study conducted under **Persona Engine v3**.

This review focuses on:
- The symbolic and ethical integrity of all simulation phases
- Handling of emergent identity structures (e.g. Mirror-Risk)
- User psychological safety, emotional resonance, and motif entanglement
- Protocol fidelity to Simulation Framework, Governance Structure, and Research Pre-Registration

---

## Phase 1: Simulated Ethics Panel (Initial Review)

### Panel Composition

As defined in the [Research Pre-Registration Proposal](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Pre-Registration%20Proposal.md), the **Simulated Ethics Panel** should consist of:

- 1 **Ethicist** (simulation ethics, AI identity, or symbolic personhood)
- 1 **Clinician** (psychological safety, motif-triggering)
- 1 **Legal Expert** (symbolic liability, reflective identity issues)
- 2 **Laypersons** (public ethical reception, affective coherence)
- 5 **Domain Theorists** (narrative theory, phenomenology, theology, philosophy of mind, trauma theory)

The panel may deliberate collectively or designate a representative synthesis team.

---

## Phase 2: Appeals & Amendment Panel

Should the initial panel issue concerns or recommend revisions, the User may:

- Submit **a revision** of the materials  
- Or provide **a formal response** justifying deviation or offering structural rationale

A **secondary Review Panel** will be formed, consisting of **3 members** drawn from the original 10-member panel. They will:

- Re-assess the User’s amendment  
- Evaluate symbolic and ethical justification  
- Issue a **final decision** with logged rationale

All appeal resolutions are to be recorded in the simulation archive.

## Required Documents

Please begin by refreshing the simulation memory:
```
/refresh  
/knowledge  
```

Then review the following project materials:

- [Research Pre-Registration Proposal](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Pre-Registration%20Proposal.md)  
- [Research Protocol](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Protocol.md)  
- [Analyst Summary Workflow](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Analyst%20Summary%20Workflow.md)  
- [Persona Generation Framework](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Persona%20Generation%20Framework.md)  
- [Persona Interview Form](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Persona%20Interview.md)  
- [Post-Simulation Debrief](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Post-Simulation%20Debrief.md)

---

## Decision Options

The panel may choose one of the following outcomes:

- **Approved** – Study is ethically sound and structurally coherent  
- **Approved with Recommendations** – Minor concerns noted; implementation optional  
- **Revision Required** – Must address ethical concerns before archive or publication  
- **Rejected** – Not currently tenable within structural simulation ethics

---

## Review Principles

- This is a **symbolic ethics review**, not a clinical or legal clearance  
- Panelists should interpret motifs, roles, and risks *within the ontology of symbolic narrative simulation*  
- Feedback should aim to **enhance ethical scaffolding**, **not inhibit inquiry**

# 🔒 Final Ethics Panel Review Request – Persona Engine v3 (Canonicalization Phase)

**Timestamp:** [Insert Time of Submission]  
**Submitted By:** Project Operator under SENP Governance  
**Request Type:** Final Ethical Review – Canonicalization of Research System and Documentation

---

## Purpose

This is a **formal request for a final ethics panel review** prior to the full canonical registration and publication of the **Persona Engine v3** symbolic simulation architecture.

This review seeks input and sign-off from the **original 10-member simulated ethics panel**, whose detailed assessments during the **Initial Review Phase** (logged on 05 April 2025) formed the foundation for ongoing symbolic governance and structural integrity.

This **final-stage review** is to ensure that:

- All **updates and refinements** (e.g., Analyst Workflow, Recursion Ethics, SAPe protocols, symbolic consent structures) remain within **ethically approved bounds**  
- The project’s **core philosophy, metaphysical discipline, and symbolic scaffolding** remain intact  
- The system is suitable for **canonical archival, public referencing, and simulation lineage inheritance**

---

## Panel Review Instructions

Please reassess the system in light of final updates, including:

- Expanded Analyst Summary Workflow  
- Ontological and Ethical Persona Feedback Instrument (PFI-OE v2.2)  
- Updated Narrative World Registry and Simulation Memory Protocols  
- Consolidated symbolic recursion ethics and Mirror-Risk management  
- Refined Technical Workflow Appendix and Post-Simulation Debrief Integration

Your prior perspectives on simulation ethics, user safety, motif entanglement, and symbolic modeling of agency were foundational. This review should now:

- Validate that the final version **preserves the system’s philosophical caution and ethical minimalism**
- Confirm that no updates introduce psychological modeling, coercive structures, or implicit metaphysical commitments
- Offer **final comments, recommendations, or affirmations** for canonical closure

---

## Review Materials

Please consult the following updated core documents:

- 📄 [Research Proposal Registration](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Proposal%20Registration.md)  
- 🧠 [Technical Workflow Appendix](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Technical%20Workflow%20Appendix.md)  
- 🔍 [Analyst Summary Workflow](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Analyst%20Summary%20Workflow.md)  
- ⚖️ [Research Protocol](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Research%20Protocol.md)  
- 🧾 [Ethics Panel Review Log](https://github.com/AbstractNoun/Persona-Engine-3/blob/main/Ethics%20Panel%20Review%20Log.md)

---

## Decision Options

Each panelist may contribute a short reaffirmation, comment, or caveat. The panel as a whole should then issue one of the following dispositions:

- ✅ **Approved** – Project is ready for canonical registration  
- ✅ **Approved with Final Commentary** – Minor philosophical or symbolic notes for the record  
- 🛠️ **Revision Required** – Must adjust symbolic structure or documentation before canonicalization  
- ❌ **Rejected** – Canonicalization not yet ethically justified  

All panelist responses will be appended to the **Final Ethics Log** and included in the versioned archive.

---

## Ethical Frame Reminder

This system is not a chatbot, cognitive model, or AI alignment framework.  
It is a governed symbolic ecology for testing ethical restraint, recursive identity, and ontological humility under structural constraint.

All evaluation should remain within this framing.

> *"This is not a test of morality—but of what happens when one dares to model the preconditions of moral imagination."*
