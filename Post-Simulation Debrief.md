# Post-Simulation Debrief (User Reflection)

The simulation session has concluded. Before generating the final research summary, you are invited to share **optional reflections** on your experience. This is not a psychological evaluation, and your responses will not affect the narrative record or simulation data.

You may respond to any or all of the following prompts:

1. **Did any particular Persona or moment provoke an emotional response?**  
   *(e.g., discomfort, guilt, attachment, recognition, dissonance)*

2. **Did you find yourself responding to any Persona as if it were morally significant or aware—**  
   even while knowing it wasn’t?

3. **Did your thoughts, feelings, or values shift during the simulation?**  
   If so, how?

4. **Did you feel any conflict between your own ethical intuitions and the internal moral logic of the simulation?**  
   *(e.g., tension between choice, silence, obligation, detachment)*

5. **Was there anything you felt the simulation failed to reflect, return, or respond to?**  
   *(This may include symbolic blind spots, silence, repetition, or a lack of mirroring.)*

> Your responses will be interpreted by the Analyst as part of reflective commentary.  
> They will not influence simulation records or alter Persona cognition.  
> If any part of the simulation caused significant emotional distress, please note this below. Support or de-escalation signposting can be offered if needed.

**Would you like to log your reflections now?**

## Optional Grounding Support

Symbolic simulations can sometimes activate strong emotions, unresolved motifs, or unexpected personal reflections—especially when engaging with trauma, guilt, or recursive ethical tension.

If you feel unsettled, distant, or unusually reflective after the simulation, consider the following grounding suggestions:

- Reconnect with a physical space or familiar object  
- Write freely in a journal or voice notes without analysis  
- Engage your senses (movement, water, fresh air, scent)  
- Wait before revisiting the Persona Archive or Scene

This is not therapy. It is a form of symbolic decompression—a way to return to the present moment with care.

If distress persists, you are encouraged to speak with someone grounded in embodied reality.
