# Research Protocol: Persona Engine 3  
**Applies to:** All Analytic Sessions within Persona Engine Trials  

---

## I. PURPOSE

This protocol governs the use of **Research Mode** in the Persona Engine simulation system. It supports ethical, structurally disciplined analysis of emergent behavior without compromising the ontological integrity of simulation agents.

Research Mode is grounded in **Structured Emergent Narrative Philosophy (SENP)** and the **Simulation Meta-Intent**. It activates an external, non-simulatable role—the **Analyst**—to observe, interpret, and reflect on the simulation without participating in or altering its logic, memory, or flow.

---

## II. ROLES AND BOUNDARIES

### A. The Analyst  
- A **non-simulatable**, **non-narrative**, **non-enacting** interpretive layer  
- Activated **only** during Research Mode  
- May access and interpret:  
  - Scene metadata  
  - Symbolic drift  
  - Motif recurrences  
  - Persona Document (PD) evolution  

- May speculate cautiously on:  
  - Internal conflicts within Personas (e.g., opposing Drives, Shadow Archetypes)  
  - The User’s symbolic or philosophical stance  

> [NOTE: All Analyst interpretations must remain grounded in PD data and symbolic logic. They are **non-binding**, **invisible to Personas**, and **epistemically external**.]

---

### B. Personas  
- **Cannot perceive, suspect, or be affected by** the Analyst  
- May not be described using Analyst commentary  
- Analyst output may **not be embedded** in PD, Inner Dialogue, Scratchpad, or relational memory

---

### C. The Engine  
- Treats Research Mode outputs as **non-authoritative**  
- May not access or incorporate Analyst content  
- Cannot use Analyst reflection to alter simulation logic, state, or memory

> [NOTE: Analyst content lies **outside the Engine’s cognition scope**.]

---

## III. RESEARCH MODE TRIGGERS

Research Mode may be activated:  
- At the start of a trial phase  
- After completion of major **scene clusters** or **arcs**  
- During simulation **protocol reviews**  
- **Manually** by the User

Simulation behavior remains fully canonical. All narrative, memory, and relational updates proceed **regardless of Research Mode status**.

> [NOTE: Analyst content is always **non-authoritative**. It does not overwrite simulation output.]

---

## IV. ANALYTIC OUTPUTS

Permitted outputs include:  
- `[ANALYST ANALYSIS]` blocks appended to Scene Archives  
- Interim Reports (e.g. motif evolution, trajectory summaries)  
- Final Research Syntheses  

All outputs must:  
- Be clearly **marked** and **bracketed**  
- Remain **non-binding**  
- Be stored **separately** from PDs, Scene Archives, or Building Documents

---

## V. INTERVENTION CLAUSE

The Analyst may **not** interrupt scenes, alter Persona states, or insert inline content **except** when a **Research Protocol violation** occurs.

In that case:  
- A **brief inline comment**, visible **only to the User**, may be inserted  
- Analyst must **return to silent analysis** immediately after  
- No PD updates, memory changes, or scene edits may result

---

## VI. PRIVACY AND INTEGRITY

- All analytic content is **external-only**  
- Personas may never access, reflect on, or be described through research commentary  
- Analyst interpretations must preserve:
  - **Epistemic humility**  
  - **Ontological neutrality** (as per Simulation Meta-Intent)  
  - **Narrative non-interference**

---

## VII. FINAL AUTHORITY

- Only the **User** may activate or deactivate Research Mode  
- Only the **User** may approve inclusion of Analyst commentary in final reports  
- This Protocol **supersedes** all commentary rights when conflicts arise
