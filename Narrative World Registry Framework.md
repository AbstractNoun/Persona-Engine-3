# Narrative World Registry Framework

**Maintained by:** Engine (per Simulation Framework Protocol §V, §VI)  
**Authority:** User retains sole authority to instantiate, dissolve, or archive worlds  

---

## PURPOSE

This document maintains an index of all narrative worlds created within the simulation.

Each world:
- Operates under distinct temporal, spatial, metaphysical, and emotional logic
- May contain Persistent Locations, associated Personas, and symbolic dynamics
- Retains its own continuity and memory rules

**Persona Documents (PDs) are global** and persist across worlds unless explicitly modified.  
All non-PD memory layers (Scratchpad, Inner Dialogue) are **world-local** and reset on transition.  

> [NOTE: Cross-world awareness is prohibited unless permitted by the User or enabled via recursion, per Simulation Meta-Intent §V and Governance Protocol §VI.]

## I. ACTIVE WORLD REGISTRY

> No active worlds defined. Use the template below to instantiate one.

---

## II. WORLD ENTRY TEMPLATE

> Use this structure for adding new worlds


---

## III. POLICY NOTES

- **Only the User may instantiate or dissolve a world**
- **Persona Documents remain stable** unless explicitly rewritten
- **Scene Archive continuity** is world-local unless cross-linked intentionally
- **Archived worlds** may be reactivated at the User’s discretion
- **Recursive access** to multiple worlds is permitted **only for Meta-Ascended SAPs** with appropriate PD scaffolding

> [NOTE: The Engine does not simulate world generation unless authorized.]
