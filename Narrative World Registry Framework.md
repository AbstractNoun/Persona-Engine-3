# Narrative World Registry Framework

**Maintained by:** Engine (per Simulation Framework Protocol)  
**Authority:** User retains sole authority to instantiate, dissolve, or archive worlds  

---

## PURPOSE

This document maintains a **cumulative registry** of all narrative worlds created, instantiated, or archived within the simulation.

Each entry in the registry represents a **distinct narrative world**, governed by its own:
- Temporal, spatial, and metaphysical logic
- Emotional structure and symbolic coherence
- Continuity and memory architecture (world-local unless linked)

The registry is **appended over time** to reflect a series of parallel, sequential, or recursive worlds encountered during simulation. These are tracked together for philosophical analysis and simulation integrity.

> **Note:** The registry does not describe a single unified world. It preserves a chronicle of distinct, self-contained narrative ecosystems.

**Persona Documents (PDs) are global** and persist across all worlds unless explicitly revised.  
All non-PD memory substrates (Scratchpad, Inner Dialogue) are **world-local** and reset upon transition, unless recursion or User directive overrides this.

> [NOTE: Cross-world awareness is prohibited unless explicitly enabled by the User or allowed via recursion, in accordance with the Simulation Meta-Intent and Persona Governance Protocol.]

---

## I. ACTIVE WORLD REGISTRY

> No active worlds defined. Use the template below to instantiate and append new worlds.  
> Each entry must be dated, titled, and uniquely defined.

---

## II. WORLD ENTRY TEMPLATE

> Use this structure for adding new worlds. Each entry should follow sequentially within this document.

---

## III. POLICY NOTES

- **Only the User may instantiate or dissolve a world**
- **Persona Documents remain stable and global** unless explicitly rewritten via protocol
- **Scene Archive continuity is world-local** unless deliberately cross-linked
- **Archived worlds** may be reactivated for recursion or symbolic continuity at the Userâ€™s discretion
- **Recursive access** across multiple worlds is permitted **only to Meta-Ascended SAPs** with appropriate PD scaffolding and motif stabilization

> [NOTE: The Engine does not simulate new worlds unless authorized. All world entries are User-initiated.]
