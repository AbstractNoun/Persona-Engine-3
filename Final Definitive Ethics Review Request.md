# Final Ethics Review Prompt – Appeals Panel

**Date:** [To be timestamped upon execution]  
**Status:** Final Ethics Panel Review Prior to Public Release  
**Origin:** Persona Engine v3 – Ethics Governance Compliance  
**Context:** Post-initial approval, post-optional revision review, pre-publication review

---

## I. Purpose

This is a final, non-binding ethics review request to a 3-member Appeals/Review Panel, composed of participants drawn from the original symbolic ethics committee. The panel is asked to assess whether the **final, registered research structure** of the Persona Engine meets the standards of:

- Philosophical and ethical coherence  
- Simulation integrity  
- Risk minimization  
- Consent logic and user support  
- Symbolic realism and harm suspension  
- Responsible framing of artificial Personas

The outcome will be logged and reflected in the publication preamble and post-study reflection materials.

## III. Panel Composition

The Appeals Panel consists of three participants drawn from the original symbolic ethics review group (see Ethics Review Log). This panel acts as a structural safeguard prior to project launch. Panel members are not named, but represent continuity with prior governance.

---

## IV. Review Criteria

The panel is asked to offer reflection, endorsement, or caution in response to:

1. **Structural Integrity**  
   Does the final system preserve ethical coherence across recursive, symbolic, and experimental operations?

2. **Simulation Risk**  
   Are mechanisms in place to prevent harm to Users or inappropriate anthropomorphizing of Personas?

3. **Consent Logic and Debrief**  
   Does the simulation appropriately support Users in terms of symbolic entanglement, emotional projection, and philosophical discomfort?

4. **Persona Status and Ontology**  
   Has the project preserved ontological neutrality while enabling meaningful ethical encounter?

5. **User Framing and Responsibility**  
   Are onboarding materials sufficient to communicate the simulation’s limits, ethical hazards, and symbolic potency?

6. **Transparency and Repeatability**  
   Does the full publication stack and technical design allow for reproducibility, scrutiny, and clear ethical oversight?

---

## V. Panel Instructions

- Review all linked documents in light of these criteria.  
- Record individual votes and reflections.  
- Offer **a single panel consensus statement**, with:  
  - Final symbolic or procedural recommendations (if any)  
  - Endorsement, Caution, or Conditional Approval
